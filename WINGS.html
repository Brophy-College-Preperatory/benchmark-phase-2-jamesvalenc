            <p>Brandon Ingram is one of the most underrated players in the NBA because of his ability to impact the game on both ends of the court. As a versatile scorer, he combines a smooth mid-range game with excellent finishing at the rim and a reliable three-point shot, making him a nightmare for defenders. Despite his consistent offensive output, Ingram often flies under the radar due to playing in a smaller market and sharing the spotlight with other stars. Additionally, his improved playmaking and defensive contributions show that he’s not just a scorer but a well-rounded player who elevates his team. Ingram’s talent and work ethic make him deserving of more recognition as one of the league’s most complete and impactful forwards.

        <p>CJ McCollum consistently produces elite scoring numbers without receiving the recognition he deserves. Over his career, McCollum has averaged nearly 20 points per game, including a career-high 23.1 points per game in the 2020-21 season, while shooting an impressive 39.5% from three-point range. Beyond scoring, he’s also an underrated playmaker, averaging over 5 assists per game during the 2023-24 season with the New Orleans Pelicans. Despite these numbers, McCollum is often overshadowed by bigger names in the league, even though he’s one of only 10 players to average 20+ points and 5+ assists while shooting 38% or better from three over multiple seasons. His consistent efficiency and versatility as a scorer, facilitator, and leader make him an invaluable player who deserves more recognition.
