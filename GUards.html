            <p>De'Aaron Fox is arguably one of the best players in the NBA due to his elite scoring, versatility, and clutch performances. During the 2024 season, he averaged a career-high 26.6 points per game on 45.6% shooting, including an impressive 36.9% from three-point range on 7.8 attempts per game. Fox's speed and ability to finish at the rim, where he converted 65.4% of his shots, make him nearly unstoppable in transition and half-court settings. Not only is he an exceptional scorer, but his defensive prowess is notable, leading the league with 2.0 steals per game. Fox's clutch performances further cement his case as an elite player, with 3.5 points per game in clutch situations ranking among the NBA's best. Moreover, the Kings had a +7.4 net rating with Fox on the court, highlighting his profound impact on winning​.</p>

            <h2>Michael Alex Conley Jr.</h2>
            <div class="container">

        <p>This guy is genuinly so tuff. (Well he used to be)</p>
    </footer>
    <p> Just because Mike Conley is an NBA vet doesn't mean he's not nice anymore. In the 2023-24 season, Conley is hitting an impressive 45.5% of his three-pointers, ranking sixth among qualified players. His versatility as a shooter is noteworthy—he shoots 46.7% on catch-and-shoot attempts, 43.8% on pull-ups, and an incredible 59.2% from the corners, showcasing his ability to adapt to various situations on the court. These shooting numbers have significantly contributed to the Minnesota Timberwolves becoming the league’s fifth-ranked team in three-point percentage. </p>
    <p> Conley's shooting consistency is invaluable, especially because he spaces the floor for his teammates like KAT and Edwards. To add on to this, his chemistry with the bigs like Rudy creates open looks, bringing yet another reason to keep him on the floor. Conley’s ability to balance his role as a floor general while simultaneously being one of the league's quietest three-point snipers makes him a backbone of Minnesota’s offense.​</p>
