            <p>Domantas Sabonis is undoubtedly one of the premier rebounders in the NBA, consistently showcasing his ability to dominate the glass. His instincts and positioning are exceptional, allowing him to anticipate where the ball will land and secure rebounds over even taller opponents. Last season, he averaged over 12 rebounds per game, a testament to his relentless effort and focus. Sabonis excels on the offensive boards, often creating second-chance opportunities for his team with his physicality and determination. His strength and technique in boxing out make him a tough matchup for opposing big men, demonstrating his skill and commitment to this critical aspect of the game. His consistency and impact on the boards solidify his status as one of the league's most valuable big men.

    <p>Jakob Poeltl is one of the most over looked defensive players, consistently contributing on both ends of the floor without the fanfare of bigger names. As a standout rebounder, Poeltl has averaged over 9 rebounds per game in recent seasons, ranking among the league's most efficient big men on the glass. His ability to dominate the boards, particularly on the offensive end, creates second-chance opportunities that are invaluable to his team. Offensively, Poeltl is a reliable scorer around the rim, shooting well above 60% from the field, showcasing his excellent finishing ability and smart shot selection. Defensively, his presence as a rim protector is undeniable, as he frequently averages around 1-2 blocks per game, while also excelling in pick-and-roll coverage. Despite these impressive contributions, Poeltl often flies under the radar, proving that his value extends far beyond the box score and deserves more recognition.</p>
